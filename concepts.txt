[
  to test the APIs we need a HTTP client.(like thunderClient or Postman)

after creating contactRoutes
[
  Now we are going to create the controllers, so that controllers is going to contain all our logic for the
  request response and it is going to connect with our database.
]

after creating contactController
[
  the next thing we are going to do is accept the body from the request
]

[
  whenever you need to accept some data from the client to our server, we need to use a body parser so that we can
  parse the stream of data that we are recieving from the client.

  for that we need to use a middleware, and express provide us a middleware for the json object which we can get from
  the client.

  express.json(); will provide the parser
]

[
  the error comes in the form of HTML format, but we need in json format and to change this, we need to create
  a custom middleware which is going to accept the request response and then in between its going to transform 
  the response into a JSON.
