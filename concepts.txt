[
  to test the APIs we need a HTTP client.(like thunderClient or Postman)
]

after creating contactRoutes
[
  Now we are going to create the controllers, so that controllers is going to contain all our logic for the
  request response and it is going to connect with our database.
]

after creating contactController
[
  the next thing we are going to do is accept the body from the request
]

[
  whenever you need to accept some data from the client to our server, we need to use a body parser so that we can
  parse the stream of data that we are recieving from the client.

  for that we need to use a middleware, and express provide us a middleware for the json object which we can get from
  the client.

  express.json(); will provide the parser
]

[
  the error comes in the form of HTML format, but we need in json format and to change this, we need to create
  a custom middleware which is going to accept the request response and then in between its going to transform 
  the response into a JSON. 
]

after errorHandler:
[
  Since, we are going to use Mongodb and the Mongoose, so whenever we interact with the Mongodb we always get a promise.

  In order to resolve that promise, we are going to make use of async await
]

[
  now since whenever we use the async and if we want to catch an error we need to make use of a try catch block and
  in order to do the try catch block we have to add the try catch Block in each of the functions(contactController).

  But there is an better way to do this and that's where we can make use of a middleware which is an express async handler,
  which is going to handle our exceptions inside the async express routes and then it's going to pass them to the
  express errorHandler which we have created here.

  lets install the express async handler -> npm install --save express-async-handler

  and import that in contactController.
]

[
  in order to use the asyncHandler you have to wrap your whole async function inside asyncHandler.

  Now, we don't have to write all the try catch blocks in order to catch the errors.
